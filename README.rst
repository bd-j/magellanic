Magellanic
=====

Code for working with magellanic cloud data

1. ```sfhs``` work with Harris and Zaritsky SFHs to predict fluxes and LFs on a spatially resolved basis

2.  ```starfit``` fit stellar SEDs (MCPS and GALEX and...) to stellar models to infer stellar and dust parameters

3. ```catalogs``` work with MCPS and SAGE catalog data
