These are mostly actually from Cioni 2006a and b

1. LMC
   K(TRGB) = 11.94
   IRAC1(TRGB) = 11.9

    K > −0.48* (J−K) +13
	and
	K < −13.333 * (J − K) + 24.666.
	and
	(
	K < K(TRGB)
	or
	IRAC1 < IRAC1(TRGB)
	)

2. SMC
   same but adjusted for distance and metallicity and using differnt TRGB magnitudes
   \Delta(J-K) = 0.05 mag (metallicity)
   \Delta m = 0.4 mag (distance)
   K(TRGB) = 12.6
   IRAC1(TRGB) = 12.6

3. x-AGB
   Then for x-agb stars we add stars that satisfy
   
   IRAC1 < IRAC1(TRGB)
   and
   (
   J-IRAC1 > 3.6
   or
   IRAC1-IRAC4 > 0.8
   )
   and
   IRAC4 < 12−(0.43 *( J −IRAC4))
   and
   (
   IRAC4 < 11.5 − (1.33 * (IRAC1-IRAC4))   {for IRAC1-IRAC4 < 3}
   or
   IRAC4 < 7.5 {for IRAC1-IRAC4 > 3}
   )
   
   Note Figure 6 of Boyer 2011 does not seem to show the last lines as stated in the text.

Hard to say

It looks like

F160 < F160(TRGB)
and
F160 > a * (F814 - F160) + b
But I'd have to measure a and b off the plots
